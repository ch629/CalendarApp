# Proposed Gantt Chart Notes

This gantt chart is a proposed estimation of work for each group member sorted by task. The gantt chart is designed with consideration to ensuring each group member has a similar amount of work to do over the course of the planning phase.

# Actual Gantt Chart Notes

This final gantt chart is the phyiscal representation of what actually happened during our project. As can be seen, each group member completed a similar amount of work, and we were able to stick to the original gantt chart in most instances. An extra task of "review" was added to the end of this gantt chart as we did not originally anticipate that this task would be required. Fortunately, due to our planning, we left several days at the end of the project free of tasks as a precaution in case this situation occured.
