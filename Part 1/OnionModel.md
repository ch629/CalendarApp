##Onion Model Explained
The onion model represents the relationship each group of stakeholders has with the final
product. The innermost ring represents the stakeholders that will directly interact with 
the product. The next ring shows members of the organisation from which the innermost 
stakeholders derive. The outer ring represents the wider environment in which the product
will exist e.g. the students won't directly interact with the product, but they will experience
its effects.
