##High Level System Architecture
The System Architecture shows the three main components of the system. The first of which is the front end client that the 
user will interact with, either the mobile application or the desktop client. The front-end act mostly as a gui and 
relay of information between the back-end and the user. The back-end server takes requests and data from the user in the gui 
and runs calculations and communicates data stored in the database back to the front-end. This seperation between the fron-end 
and the back-end allows for better security and portability in the future as a mobile interface and desktop client can both
communicate with the same back-end, rather than having to repeat yourself accross platforms.
